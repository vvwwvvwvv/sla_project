Let Us Pray,...a Chosen Few,"Hail covens, this is it
A thousand amps toll the end time riff
The sky a coffin lid
All condemned beneath its shadow
The chosen few, the chosen knew
Spelled out in the stars his prophecy
Raise your fists; now you exist
The bell of doom strikes   th hour

The time has come
All the chosen, time to put down your bongs
Take up a knife; end all life
Legalise drugs and murder
Satanas luciferus we pledge these souls to you
Now satan's slaves, your lives weren't saved
Die now in the shadow of the pentagram

The chosen few, look up in the sky
The chosen few, waiting for the sign
The chosen few, still children of the grave
Satan's slaves"
We Live,Another Perfect Day?,"Today I stopped and stared
I realised I just don't care
A chasm black and wide
Between me and mankind

I've walked this earth      years
Seen the pain and the tears
An outcast all alone
Take me back beyond the sun...."
Dopethrone,Barbarian,"He left the northern hills to seek his fortune
A lone Barbarian with only death lust to guide
But he carved a kingdom of stone
King Conan, sitting on his bloody throne, no

His black mane sweeps across his face
Grim and silent with steely blue gaze
Like a panther ready to strike
His blade crashes down to end your life, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess, a true measure of a man
You think you're civilized but you will never understand

Master swordsman of Hyborian Age
His name is a legend to this very day
Even gods cower when his sword is unleashed
Nothing dare face him, neither man or beast, no

Cut a bloody swathe across his battlefield
Red mist rising, break your human shield
Slashed to pieces is to be your fate
Unleash berserker rage no one shall escape, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess the true nature of a man
You think you're civilized but you will never understand

You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You will never understand"
Electric Wizard,Behemoth,"     
His blackened wings shadow the Earth
This age of fire is his rebirth
Awakened now in these troubled times
He's come to judge us for our crimes

   
Behemoth
Behemoth

     
Day of judgment, it has arrived
All you sinners, you're gonna die
The Lord has shown you the way to live
Stop your hate, you've got to give

   

     
Were you a slave
And told what to do
If that's so
He's come for you
Did you follow
Religion is a lie
Be not afraid
You're gonna die
You're gonna die
So change now, before it's too late
Or life in servitude will be your fate
Be free, do as you will
Love and happiness, you take your fill

   "
Electric Wizard,Black Butterfly,"Terror above, beautiful as the night
Black butterfly in full flight
Traveling through the void of space
To this long forgotten place

Druids gather at the circle of stones
To worship the ancient ones
In the glow of the dying red sun
Their rites of evil have only just begun

Evil monks fall to their knees
Black colossus, they must not see
Crystal shards drop from inside
Filling circles in their minds

Thirteen maidens awaiting sacrifice
Screaming, naked, they will slowly die
Blood has mingled with crystal drips ice
Open caverns of eternal midnight"

Black Masses,Black Mass,"Lucifer I summon thee to my black mass
I call upon you to complete my evil task
My heart is black and my soul is dead
Hear my words of hate give me strength

Hear me Lucifer, black mass, black mass
Take me higher, higher, black mass, black mass
Hear me Lucifer, black mass, black mass

Faceless ones summon me to crypts below
