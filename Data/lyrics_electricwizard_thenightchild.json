Join us and be free\n\nYour rotten world means nothing to me\nUndercover of darkness is when I am free\nThe Nightchild is creeping, forever seeking\nNew bodies new victims, drug and murder addicted\n\nI am the Nightchild, shadows gather round me\nAre you a Nightchild? Join us and be free\n\nI am the Nightchild, I am the Nightchild\nI am the Nightchild, I am the Nightchild\nI am the Nightchild, I am the Nightchild\n\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun\nUnder the black sun, under the black sun", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a727f894cc58c3f591536fbf449da67c.1000x885x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Electric Wizard"}
