I just need\nIncense for the Damned\nOur lives are condemned\nIncense for the Damned\nOur lives are condemned anyway...\nMarijuana burns inside my crypt\nHigh up here I don't need to take your shit\nYou people try to bring us down\nBut soon you'll all be chocking on\nIncense for the Damned\nI wanna get high before I die\nI wanna get high before I die, I wanna die....\nLike Caligula is how I would treat this world if it were mine...\nBut this world has no love for me\nA useless freak, turn your back to society....\nWe wanna get high before we die\nWe wanna get high before we die\nWe wanna die...I wanna die", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2bfddd3aadc9a636afa6c76e90a2d32a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Electric Wizard"}
