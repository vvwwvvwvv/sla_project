Saturn's children the living dead\nWe have created this abyss, darkness, surrounding us\nRaise the flag of hate against this human race\nRise and kill & wipe them all away....\nI Am Nothing\nI Mean Nothing\nI See Nothing\nI Feel Nothing...as I kill you\nWe the Old Ones did not forget\nWe are the Supercoven, we wait with bated breath\nThey think themselves as Gods ..now are they free?\nMindless slaves to their lusts and technology\nI Am Nothing\nI Mean Nothing\nI See Nothing\nI Feel Nothing....as I kill you\nI Am Nothing\nI Feel Nothing\nI Am Nothing\nYou Are Nothing....\nTo Me...\nNothing...\nNothing...\nI Feel Nothing as I kill you.....", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2bfddd3aadc9a636afa6c76e90a2d32a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Electric Wizard"}
