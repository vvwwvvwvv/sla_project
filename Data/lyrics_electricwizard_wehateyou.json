Fear and frightened people who kill what they can't understand.\"\n\nA seed of hate from the day I was born\nMy right to vengeance from me has been torn\nHopeless and drugged - my black emotions seethe\nLoveless and cold - my hate begins to breed\n\nBlack nebula, seething in my brain\nThen your fucking world brings me down again\nSo I'll take my fathers gun and I walk down to the street\nI'll have my vengeance now with everyone I meet, yeah!\n\nA seed of hate from the day I was born\nMy right to vengeance from me has been torn\nHopeless and drugged - my black emotions seethe\nLoveless and cold - my hate begins to breed\n\nWe... hate you!
