Let Us Pray,...a Chosen Few,"Hail covens, this is it
A thousand amps toll the end time riff
The sky a coffin lid
All condemned beneath its shadow
The chosen few, the chosen knew
Spelled out in the stars his prophecy
Raise your fists; now you exist
The bell of doom strikes   th hour

The time has come
All the chosen, time to put down your bongs
Take up a knife; end all life
Legalise drugs and murder
Satanas luciferus we pledge these souls to you
Now satan's slaves, your lives weren't saved
Die now in the shadow of the pentagram

The chosen few, look up in the sky
The chosen few, waiting for the sign
The chosen few, still children of the grave
Satan's slaves",
We Live,Another Perfect Day?,"Today I stopped and stared
I realised I just don't care
A chasm black and wide
Between me and mankind

I've walked this earth      years
Seen the pain and the tears
An outcast all alone
Take me back beyond the sun....",
Dopethrone,Barbarian,"He left the northern hills to seek his fortune
A lone Barbarian with only death lust to guide
But he carved a kingdom of stone
King Conan, sitting on his bloody throne, no

His black mane sweeps across his face
Grim and silent with steely blue gaze
Like a panther ready to strike
His blade crashes down to end your life, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess, a true measure of a man
You think you're civilized but you will never understand

Master swordsman of Hyborian Age
His name is a legend to this very day
Even gods cower when his sword is unleashed
Nothing dare face him, neither man or beast, no

Cut a bloody swathe across his battlefield
Red mist rising, break your human shield
Slashed to pieces is to be your fate
Unleash berserker rage no one shall escape, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess the true nature of a man
You think you're civilized but you will never understand

You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You think you're civilized but you will never understand
You will never understand",
